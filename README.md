#US2MapperKit
![alt tag](/documentation/readme_assets/mapperkit_header.png?raw=true)

Inspired by [CSMapper](https://github.com/marcammann/CSMapper) and [Mogenerator](https://github.com/rentzsch/mogenerator), US2MapperKit is an extremely lightweight mapping framework designed specifically for Swift 1.2, and Swift 2.0.

Unlike previous frameworks, where an object model is manually created by the developer then retrofitted with a mapping framework at a later point, US2MapperKit takes a mapping-first approach. By mapping against dictionary data up front, US2MapperKit generates the model objects based on the mapping, and allows for the extensibility inspired by the [Protocol-Oriented Programming](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2015/?id=408) talk at WWDC.

##Core Concept

![alt tag](/documentation/readme_assets/basic_concept_image.png?raw=true)

The simple example above demonstrates the inner workings of the US2MapperKit. In this example we will attemp to map a Person object returned in the form a dictionary. The first step is to manually generate a plist representing the data that is being returned. This plist defines properties, data types, the mapping keys associated with the response dictionary, and any transformation that needs to be applied. Once defined, a build-time script will generate two model object files representing the model mapping.

The first class generated in the diagram represents the internal `_Person.swift` class, which contains script-generated property definitions, along two initializers, one required, and one fail-able. The generated fail-able initializer takes in a `Dictionary<String, AnyObject>` input value which is parsed to the model. The internal files purpose is to support the framework by mapping the response data and should not be modified by the developer since the script will regenerate it every time the project is built.

The second class generated is the `Person.swift` which inherits from the internal `_Person.swift` class. This provides a means for developer to append any custom logic, properties, or implementations of protocols as needed during the development process. This class is only generated once, and will never be overwritten during the build task. Thus updating the model mapping will not affect any logic defined in the external class.

##Features

* Auto generation of model objects via .plists files
* Optional & Non-Optional support for:
	* String
	* Int
	* Double
	* Float
	* Bool
* Collections Support for:
	* Array\<AnyObject\>
	* Dictionary\<String, AnyObject\>
* Complex Type Support (stand alone, and in collections)
* Default Value Definitions
* Mapping Nested Values
* Complex Transformations
* Structs, Enums, Closures, Tuples via Transformations

##Basic Use

####Initialization with Dictionary

Once configured per the [Installation](/documentation/installation.md) instructions:

1. Create a plist model mapping and place it in the mapping folder defined during installation.
2. Build the target, navigate to the output directory defined during the installation process, and add the generated files to the project.
3. Map the data to an instance, call the fail-able initializer generated by US2MapperKit with the `Dictionary<String, AnyObject>` data to parse.

	```
let newInstance = TestModelObject(dataDictionary)
	```

####Update with Dictionary

Once an instance has been initialized, we can pass a new dictionary with values to update for the current instance by calling `updateWithDictionary(dictionary : Dictionary<String, AnyObject>?)`. Note that only the values which are being passed within will be updated, defaults values are ignored unline the initialization

```
let instance = TestModelObject(dataDictionary)
let newValuesDictionary = [... : ...]

// Updates the current values only with the new values received, defaults in mapping are ignored
instance.updateWithDictionary(newValuesDictionary)

```
